## Linear Regression Analysis Project

This project demonstrates the process of building and evaluating a Linear Regression model
to predict a target variable based on selected features. The dataset was preprocessed,
analyzed for outliers, and split into training and testing sets.

### Dataset
1. **Source:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/juhibhojani/house-price)
2. **Description:** Dataset contains features and target variable for regression analysis.
3. **Preprocessing Steps:**
   - Handled missing values
   - Outlier detection and removal
   - Feature engineering
   - Train-test split (typically 80%-20%)

### Modeling
- **Algorithm:** Linear Regression  
- **Library Used:** scikit-learn  
- **Features Used:** [list your main features]  
- **Target Variable:** [target column name]  
- **Training Process:**
  - Fitted model on training set
  - Evaluated using test set
  - Residual analysis performed

### Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R-squared (RÂ²)

### Results
- **Observations:**
  - Residuals analyzed for randomness
  - Model performance acceptable with minimal bias
  - Potential improvements: feature selection, scaling, and handling multicollinearity

### Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib / seaborn
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

### Usage
- Modify features or target column as needed
- Train model and evaluate metrics
